# cross-reference

Create cross references in InDesign documents.  

## Getting Started
Install and run the script like explained in [this guide](http://indesignsecrets.com/how-to-install-scripts-in-indesign.php).  

## Documentation

The script will look for text formatted like this:  

    [[NumberName YYYY]]

and create a hyperlink to text formatted like this:  

    {{NumberName YYYY}}

It will create a log file in a folder called "script-logs" next to you InDesign document. You can see which link got created and which ones have missing sources or targets.  

If your document was not saved it will ask you to save.  

Take a look into the hyperlinks panel of your InDesign.
